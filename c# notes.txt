when starting a c# project we can have the cli build a new directory for our project by typing in the console "sudo dotnet new console -o ProjectName"

to run your project type in the console "sudo dotnet run"

if you need to inject a variable into a string you need to $"{variable} place other text string here"

in c# it is mandatory to specify what type of variable the variable will be i.e.(string, int, double, bool)

c# data types 

- int (a normal integer value range)
- long int (much bigger integer value range, one i may never need)
- short int
- float (decimal number)
- double (an oddly more specific float?)
- char (words)
- bool (i should really already know what a bool is)
